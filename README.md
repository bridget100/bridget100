# 👋 Hi, I'm Bridget

I'm a Data Scientist and Analytics enthusiast with a strong foundation in geospatial science and a growing passion for using data to drive meaningful change across sectors — from financial inclusion to climate resilience and maternal health.

With a background in Land Surveying & Geomatics and a Master's in Data Science and Analytics in progress, I bring a unique perspective that blends spatial intelligence with machine learning, storytelling, and statistical rigor.
